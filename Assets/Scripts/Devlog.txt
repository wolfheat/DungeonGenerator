13/5	* Project started
		* Added Rule Tiles
		* Added Rule Tile 3D creator that takes tilesprites generating 3D objects
14/5	* Added levels for the generator
		* Added custom window for enabling tilemaps and levels
		* Combined doors with walls by enhanced tilerules
		* Doors and walls are now on same layer
		* Recreated Git file cause of failed first time
16/5	* Made 3D tilemap class handle all transitions between states
18/5	* Added fast update for changes in tilemap
		* Made buttons and text align in the Controls
20/5	* Added an update all force button
		* Implemented scriptable object data for defining tiles to objects mapping
23/5	* Moved stuff in the tile palette and added rotated versions of the doors and stairs
		* Tidied up changeWatcher code
		* Got basic movement working
		* Implemented moving up and down in stairs
		* Adjusted speed in stairs
25/5	* Fixed not reading walls overlapbox issue
26/5	* Started adding back Items tilemap for doors etc
		* Made a enable class that enables all tileObjects when game is run
		* Started working on getting toggle between tilemaps if any mode is selected
27/5	* Reworked the generator dungeon window. And system for handeling active maps
30/5	* Removed the Undo part from the code since it did not work correctly. Might have to limit player from running undo in object mode
		* Added new tilemap grass outdoor
		* Tilemap can bind to defaultTilemaps
		* Tilemap outdoor now has colliders so player cant walk off paths


		// Add outdooor tilemaps simple





		// Fix the undo registration

		void Generate3DTilesForced()
{
    // Optional: group everything the watcher does into one undo step
    int group = Undo.GetCurrentGroup();
    Undo.IncrementCurrentGroup();
    Undo.SetCurrentGroupName("Generate 3-D Tiles");

    foreach (var tile in tilesToInstantiate)
    {
        GameObject go = /* your instantiation logic */;
        Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo(go, "Create 3-D Tile");
        // If you parent it, do that through Undo as well
        Undo.SetTransformParent(go.transform, parentTransform, "Parent 3-D Tile");
    }

    // If you delete old ones
    foreach (var old in objectsToRemove)
        Undo.DestroyObjectImmediate(old);      // registers a deletable step

    Undo.CollapseUndoOperations(group);
}




		// Have developers able to set instant stairs?

		// Implement doors?



		* Make the changes for tilemaps code better
		* Make changing rotation of stairs update the map correctly


		// WANTS
		// Make the new tilemap autoselect in hierachy so painting can be done on it directly
